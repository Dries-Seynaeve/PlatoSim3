For Users (via Conda)
=====================

To make life easier on the people who want to use PlatoSim without ever wanting to touch the code, we use `Jenkins
<https://www.jenkins.io/>`_ to automatically build PlatoSim. Jenkins enables you to download the latest successfully
built version of the :ref:`master or develop branch <install_source_branching>`, or any specific version(s) of these.
For more information, see the :ref:`section about Jenkins <install_conda_jenkins>`. The flowchart below summarises the steps
you have to take.

*Prerequisites*
---------------

.. important::
   
   To be able to install PlatoSim via Conda you need to have the Python distribution `Anaconda <https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/>`_ (or Miniconda) installed. The current Jenkins' build requires **Python version 3.12**.

First, create a Conda environment (e.g. called ``platosim``):

.. code-block:: shell
		
   conda create -n platosim python=3.12

Activate your new conda environment:

.. code-block:: shell

   conda activate platosim		
   
It is advised to use multiple Conda environments if you want to be able to switch between versions and/or branches in a
smooth way (e.g. between ``platosim_master`` and ``platosim_develop``). We also recommend to create a new Conda
environment, rather than trying to update your existing one, when you switch to a different version of Python. Find
more information on how to use and manage `Conda environments
<https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html>`_.

*Installing* 
------------

Start by activating your desired Conda environment. The installation procedures below will automatically detect which operating system you are running and will install the appropriate packages for you.

Before you install PlatoSim via conda, for the first time in this environment, type: 

.. code-block:: shell
		
   conda config --add channels conda-forge
   
We recommend to install the ``master`` branch, unless you are interested in a feature that only exists on the ``develop`` branch. To install the latest version of the ``master`` branch use:

.. code-block:: shell

   conda install -c https://plato:miSotalP@jenkins.miricle.org/platosim/ platosim

To install the latest version of the ``develop`` branch, use:

.. code-block:: shell

   conda install -c https://plato:miSotalP@jenkins.miricle.org/platosim.devel/ platosim

To install a specific version of either the ``master`` or ``develop`` branch, simply append ``platosim=<version>`` to the above commands.

.. _install_conda_updating:

*Updating* 
----------

You may wish to update your installation when a new PlatoSim release becomes available. To update the ``master``
branch, simply use:

.. code-block:: shell

   conda update --force-reinstall -c  https://plato:miSotalP@jenkins.miricle.org/platosim/ platosim
      
Accordingly, if you want to update the ``develop`` branch, type:

.. code-block:: shell

   conda update --force-reinstall -c  https://plato:miSotalP@jenkins.miricle.org/platosim.devel/ platosim

.. _install_conda_python:

*Python packages*
-----------------

Conda, for which Jenkins depends on, is unfortunately not capable of installing the full suite of Python packages needed to use PlatoSim's built-in Python interface. Thus, minimally you need to install the packages listed under the section ``[project] dependencies`` in the file `pyproject.toml <https://github.com/IvS-KULeuven/PlatoSim3/blob/master/pyproject.toml>`_. Rather than installing each of the Python libraries one-by-one yourself, we use `uv <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/>`_ to install all packages in one command. Older PlatoSim versions used Poetry, which is no longer supported.

**Install uv**

First install uv by following `uv's documentation <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/>`_, e.g.:

.. code-block:: shell

   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

**Install Python packages**

As a user, you need to download the ``pyproject.toml`` file from either the `master branch <https://github.com/IvS-KULeuven/PlatoSim3/blob/master/pyproject.toml>`_ or the `develop branch <https://github.com/IvS-KULeuven/PlatoSim3/blob/develop/pyproject.toml>`_, depending on which branch you have installed. We recommend to store this file in your ``$CONDA_PREFIX/python`` directory which accordingly points to your active Conda environment.

Activate your Conda environment, move to the directory where the ``pyproject.toml`` file is located, and install the packages with:

.. code-block:: shell

   uv pip install -r pyproject.toml

Because a Conda environment is active, uv installs the packages into that environment (rather than creating a new virtual environment). Verify the success of the installation by typing ``uv pip list``.

You have now installed the default Python package distribution of PlatoSim, which is sufficient for running the `Jupyter notebook tutorials <https://github.com/IvS-KULeuven/PlatoSim3/tree/master/docs/tutorials>`_ and to use most of PlatoSim's Python modules for scripting. Always remember to activate your Conda environment before using PlatoSim's Python interface.

Extra packages are organised in dependency groups (``picsim``, ``varsim``, ``platonium``, ``pipeline``, ``tools``, and ``docs``; see :ref:`Python packages for developers <install_source_python>`). Install them with ``--group``, e.g. for the HDF5 viewer argos:

.. code-block:: shell

   uv pip install -r pyproject.toml --group tools

*A word about Jenkins*
----------------------

We are using `Jenkins <https://www.jenkins.io/>`_ to automatically build PlatoSim and make pre-built software available for a myriad of operating systems. The figure below summarises how we want to use it.

Each time code is pushed to the repository (either to the ``master`` or the ``develop`` branch) or a pull request is merged in GitHub, Jenkins will start building the new code, resolve the dependencies for you, and make it available via the Conda installation command. In case the build was successful, users can install this build on their system.

To monitor the status of the PlatoSim builds, check `here <https://jenkins.miricle.org/view/Platosim/>`_.
