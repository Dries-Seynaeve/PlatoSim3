Configuration parameters
------------------------
   
To configure the PlatoSim, a large set of configuration parameters is required. The input file format used for PlatoSim3 is `YAML <https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/>`_. All configuration parameters and files are read from the default YAML file called `inputfile.yaml <https://github.com/IvS-KULeuven/PlatoSim3/blob/develop/inputfiles/inputfile.yaml>`_ located in the ``inputfiles/`` directory. The default file is configured for a normal camera (N-CAM) with its *as required* performance at Beginning Of Life (BOL). To configure a fast camera (F-CAM), we recommend to use the Python methods ``Simulation.useNormalCamera()`` and ``Simulation.useFastCamera()`` (see :doc:`Run simulations <run_simulations>`) rather than editing the parameters by hand. The different blocks in the configuration files reflect their function in the simulation. We use only a very limited set of the YAML functionality, enough to allow us to provide input files for different parts of the simulator.

*General*
.........

The general configuration parameters are listed in the **General** block of the configuration file. The structure of this block is the following:

.. code-block:: shell

   General:
   
       ProjectLocation:             ENV['PLATO_PROJECT_HOME']

.. _run_input_parameters_observing:

*Observing Parameters*
......................

The **ObservingParameters** block of the configuration file contains the configuration parameters that are specific to the simulated observation and are not specific for the hardware components of the satellite. The structure of this block is the following:

.. code-block:: shell

   ObservingParameters:

     MissionDuration:                 4.5             
     NumExposures:                    10              
     BeginExposureNr:                 0              
     CycleTime:                       25              
     Fluxm0:                          1.00179e8       
     StarCatalogFile:                 inputfiles/starcatalog.txt

**MissionDuration** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`> 0` yr

Total duration of the mission, from Beginning Of Life (BOL) to End Of Life (EOL). This will be used to model the parameter degradation over time due to ageing.

**NumExposures:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`> 0`

Number of exposures to generate in the simulation.

**BeginExposureNr:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\ge 0`

Sequential number of the first exposure. Useful for `Slurm <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slurm_Workload_Manager>`_ parallelisation. In that case, long simulations (i.e. with a large number of exposures) will be chopped up into smaller simulations, covering a small number of exposures (see the Fig. 1).

.. figure:: ../figures/config_chopUpSimulation.png
   :align: center
   :width: 900

   **Fig. 1**: Long simulations can be chopped up into smaller simulations for parallelisation.
	   
**CycleTime:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`> 0` s

Image cycle time. This is the sum of the integration time of one exposure and the subsequent readout:
   
:math:`t_{\text{cycle}} = t_{\text{exp}} + t_{\text{readout}}`

For the normal cameras, the latter is the total readout time; for the fast cameras, it is the time for the frame transfer (i.e. to transfer the content of the upper CCD half to the lower CCD half).

**Fluxm0:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`> 0 \ \gamma \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{cm}^{-2}`

Flux of a star of zero magnitude (:math:`m_{\lambda} = 0`) in the passband of the magnitudes that are listed in the star catalogue below.

For an exposure of :math:`t_{\rm exp}` seconds, the measured flux :math:`F_{\gamma}` of a star, expressed in photons :math:`\gamma`, is computed from its catalogue magnitude :math:`m_{\lambda}`, the effective light-collecting area :math:`A` (in :math:`\text{cm}^2`) of the telescope, the transmission efficiency :math:`T_{\lambda}` of the optical system, the quantum efficiency :math:`Q_{\lambda}` of the detector, and the flux per second :math:`F_0` of a star with zero magnitude (:math:`m_{\lambda} = 0`) from the equation:

:math:`F_{\lambda} = t_{\rm exp} \ F_0\ T_{\lambda}\ Q_{\lambda} \ A \ 10^{-0.4 \, m_{\lambda}}` 

where the :math:`\lambda` refers to the wavelength range in which the simulation is performed.

**StarCatalogFile:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` Path to _`Star Catalog File`

Path to the star catalogue file containing three columns, separated by a space, holding the following information:

* Right ascension of the stars [deg]
* Declination of the stars [deg]
* Stellar magnitude (in passband corresponding to ``Fluxm0``)
  
A fourth column is optional and should contain positive integers, serving as star identifier. If absent, the line number will act as star identifier (counting starts at 1). Note that by default PlatoSim uses the Long Observational Phase (LOP) South field from the `PLATO Input Cata (PIC1.1) <https://tools.ssdc.asi.it/asPICtool/>`_.

.. _run_input_parameters_sky:

*Sky*
.....

The **Sky** block of the configuration file contains all the information that is specific to the sky, i.e. sky background, variable sources, cosmics, and stray light. The structure of this block is the following:

.. code-block::

   Sky:

     SkyBackground:
       UseConstantSkyBackground:      yes
       BackgroundValue:               -1
     IncludeVariableSources:          no
     VariableSourceList:              inputfiles/varsource.txt
     IncludeCosmicsInSubField:        yes
     IncludeCosmicsInSmearingMap:     yes
     IncludeCosmicsInBiasMap:         yes
     Cosmics:
       CosmicHitRate:                 10
       TrailLength:                   [0, 15]
       Intensity:                     [2500., 2000., 30.]
     StrayLight:
       IncludeStrayLight:             no
       FilePath:                      inputfiles/Plato_straylight_example_index_2574.csv
       PstRadiancePath:               inputfiles/pst.hdf5
       Time0:                         20260718T015614

**SkyBackground:**
       
  SkyBackground/**UseConstantSkyBackground:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` ``yes`` and ``no``

  If ``yes`` a constant sky background over the entire subfield will be computed.
  If ``no`` a gradient sky background will be computed if ``BackgroundValue`` is set to negative.

  SkyBackground/**BackgroundValue:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\in \mathbb{Z} \, \gamma \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{pixel}^{-1}`

  In case a positive value is given (:math:`>0`), the sky background, is simply set to the given value over the entire subfield.

  .. figure:: ../figures/config_skyBackground.png
     :align: center
     :width: 550

     **Fig. 2**: Aitoff projection of the sky background map in Galactic coordimates.

  In case a negative value is given (:math:`<0`), the sky background is automatically computed from tabulations of a zodiacal and galactic sky map. Fig. 2 shows the interpolated sky background map used where the blue dashed line is the ecliptica and the orange and magenta crosses are current LOP North and South pointings. Note that the sky background value has not been multiplied with the tranmission efficiency yet.

**IncludeVariableSources:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` ``yes`` and ``no``

Indicates whether or not stellar variability must be included.

**VariableSourceList:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` Path to _`Variable Source List`

In case you want to include stellar variability for the sources in the star catalogue, you must provide an ascii file with two columns, separated by a space:

* Star identifier (the same as in the star catalogue)
* Path to the Variable Source File indicating how the magnitude of this particular source varies over time.

The latter files also consist of two columns separated by a space:

* Time [sec]
* Delta magnitude (with zero mean)

**IncludeCosmicsInSubField:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` ``yes`` and ``no``

Indicates whether or not cosmics must be added to the pixel map.

**IncludeCosmicsInBiasMap:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` ``yes`` and ``no``

Indicates whether or not cosmics must be added to the bias register map.

**IncludeCosmicsInSmearingMap:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` ``yes`` and ``no``

Indicates whether or not cosmics must be added to the smearing map.

**Cosmics:**

The configuration parameters in the Cosmics section are the parameters characterising the cosmic hits. The excess electrons of the cosmic hits are distributed over a trail, characterised by a decay function of the form:

:math:`f(t) = \exp{\left(\frac{-t^2}{2 \, \sigma^2}\right)}`

The following parameters are only applicable if cosmics are included in at least one of the above image maps.
      
  Cosmics/**CosmicHitRate:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\geq 0 \, \text{events} \, \text{cm}^{2} \, \text{s}^{-1}`  

  Mean cosmic hit rate. The actual cosmic hit rate for any exposure is sampled randomly from a Poisson distribution with the mean cosmic hit rate as mean. The number of cosmic hits in the simulated subfield is calculated by multiplying the actual cosmic hit rate with the size of the subfield and the cycle time.

  Cosmics/**TrailLength:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`> \{0, 0\} \ \text{cm}`

  Interval for the allowed length of the cosmic trails.

  Cosmics/**Intensity:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`> \{0, 0, 0\} \ \text{e}^-` 

  Location, scale (:math:`> 0`), and shape of the skew-normal distribution from which the total number of electrons of a cosmic hit (that are to be spread over the trail) is drawn.

**StrayLight:**

Stray light from the Moon. For every exposure, PlatoSim computes the position of the Moon (and the Sun) w.r.t. the spacecraft and the camera boresight, and adds the resulting stray light, scaled by the Point Source Transmittance (PST) of the camera, to the subfield.

  StrayLight/**IncludeStrayLight:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` ``yes`` and ``no``

  Indicates whether or not stray light must be included. The parameters below are only used if ``IncludeStrayLight = yes``.

  StrayLight/**FilePath:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` Path to _`Stray Light Ephemeris File`

  Comma-separated (CSV) file with the ephemerides of the spacecraft, the Sun, and the Moon. Lines starting with ``#`` are skipped. Each row holds a time stamp (format ``YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS``) in the first column, the spacecraft position :math:`(X, Y, Z)` in columns 4-6, the Sun position in columns 8-10, and the Moon position in columns 12-14, all in km in the EME2000 frame. See the example file ``inputfiles/Plato_straylight_example_index_2574.csv`` for the exact layout.

  StrayLight/**PstRadiancePath:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` Path to _`PST File`

  HDF5 file with the Point Source Transmittance (PST) of the camera as a function of the off-axis angle of the source, for several azimuth angles and wavelengths.

  StrayLight/**Time0:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` Time stamp ``YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS``

  Time stamp in the ephemeris file that corresponds to exposure number 0. The ephemeris file must cover the full time span of the simulation.

*Platform*
..........

The **Platform** block of the configuration file contains all the information that is specific to the platform of the satellite. The structure of this block is the following:

     UseJitter:                       yes             
     JitterSource:                    FromRedNoise
     JitterYawRms:                    0.038
     JitterPitchRms:                  0.038
     JitterRollRms:                   0.040

     JitterFileName:                  inputfiles/jitter.txt

**Orientation:**

The orientation of the spacecraft can be configured either through the the sky (coordinate) angles (:math:`\alpha`, :math:`\delta`, :math:`\kappa`) or using a so-called `Quaternion <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion>`_.
     
  Angles/**RAPointing:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\alpha \in [0, 360]` deg

  Right ascension of the platform pointing.

  Angles/**DecPointing:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\delta \in [-90, 90]` deg
      
  Declination of the platform pointing.
     
  Angles/**SolarPanelOrientation:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\kappa \in [0, 360]` deg

  Orientation angle of the solar panel. This is the roll angle of the platform, which enables orienting the solar panels towards the Sun each quarter, i.e. at the beginning of each quarter the roll angle must be increased by 90 degrees (being either 0, 90, 180, and 270). Note that to properly account for the re-orientation of the solar panels, simulations must be chopped up in chunks of maximum three months (one mission quarter).

  Quaternion/**Components:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\in [-1, 1]` for all four component. 

  A unit quaternion to transform from the equatorial to the platfrom reference frame.
  
**UseJitter:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` ``yes`` and ``no``

Indicates whether pointing variations should be taken into account.

PlatoSim can also account for pointing variations of the spacecraft, so-called jitter. A time series of pointing displacement, expressed in Euler angles (yaw, pitch, roll), either has to be provided as a jitter file or will be generated based on the given jitter parameters (see further). To ensure a realistic modelling of the jitter, the time step of the jitter time series must be smaller than the exposure time.

.. figure:: ../figures/config_jitterOfPayload.png
   :align: center
   :width: 400

   **Fig. 3**: Platform configuration for AOCS Jitter.
	   
The configuration of the jitter axes is depicted below. The Euler angles that characterise the jitter are defined w.r.t. to the spacecraft coordinate system (see Fig. 3). The origin of this coordinate system is the geometric centre of the interface between the bottom of the optical bench and the service module. The positive roll axis :math:`Z_{\rm PLM}` points towards the operator-given mean payload line-of-sight, given by the equatorial coordinates (``RApointing``, ``DecPointing``, ``solarPanelOrientation``).

The angles are defined such that they increase with a clockwise rotation, when looking along the positive axes. First a roll rotation is done around the :math:`Z_{\rm PLM}` axis, then a pitch rotation is done around the rotated :math:`Y_{\rm PLM}` axis, and finally a yaw rotation is done around the twice-rotated :math:`X_{\rm SC}` axis.

**JitterSource:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` ``FromRedNoise``, ``FromFile``, and ``FromNetwork``

Indicates from where to read the jitter:

* ``FromRedNoise``: Jitter positions must be generated from the jitter parameters;
* ``FromFile``    : Jitter time series must be read from a jitter file;
* ``FromNetwork`` : Jitter positions must be read from a network (see :ref:`ControlTcpConnection <run_input_parameters_tcp>`).

**JitterYawRms:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\ge 0` arcsec

Standard deviation of the normal distribution (with zero mean) describing the yaw value from one jitter position to the next one. This entry is only applicable if ``JitterSource = FromRedNoise``.

**JitterPitchRms:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\ge 0` arcsec

Standard deviation of the normal distribution (with zero mean) describing the pitch value from one jitter position to the next one. This entry is only applicable if ``JitterSource = FromRedNoise``.

**JitterRollRms:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\ge 0` arcsec

Standard deviation of the normal distribution (with zero mean) describing the roll value from one jitter position to the next one. This entry is only applicable if ``JitterSource = FromRedNoise``.

**JitterTimeScale:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`> 0` s

Timescale of the jitter (i.e. time between two subsequent jitter positions). This entry is only applicable if ``JitterSource = FromRedNoise``.

**JitterFileName:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` Path to _`Jitter File`

If ``JitterSource = FromFile``, a jitter time series must be provided in a file ascii format. This file should contain four columns, separated by a space, holding the following information:

* Time  [s]
* Yaw   [arcsec]
* Pitch [arcsec]
* Roll  [arcsec]

.. warning::

   To ensure a realistic modelling of the jitter, the time step in the jitter time series must be smaller than the exposure time.

     DriftFileName:                   inputfiles/drift.txt

**GroupID:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` ``1``, ``2``, ``3``, ``4``, ``Fast``, and ``Custom`` 

The telescope group identifier can be used to select a camera group. As shown in Fig. 4, there are four groups that have a tilt angle of :math:`9.2^{\circ}` - from the optical axis of the satellite, and one group for the fast camera's which is aligned with the platform :math:`Z_{\rm PLM}` axis (black dot of Fig. 4). When you specify ``GroupID = Custom``, the tilt angle and azimuth angle below the ``GroupID`` in the inputfile are used, otherwise the angles are taken from predefined parameters in the :ref:`CameraGroups <run_input_parameters_groups>` block of the configuration file.

.. figure:: ../figures/config_cameraGroups.png
   :align: center
   :width: 400

   **Fig. 4**: FOV for the different camera groups.

**TiltAngle:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\in [0, 90]` deg

Tilt angle of the telescope. This angle, together with the azimuth angle, characterises the orientation of the telescope pointing (i.e. telescope optical axis) w.r.t. the platform pointing. This parameter is only used if ``GroupID = Custom``.

The tilt angle is the offset between the camera optical axis and the platform pointing, i.e. the angle between the camera line-of-sight (positive :math:`Z_{\rm CAM}` axis and the positive :math:`Z_{\rm PLM}` axis (see Fig. 4).

**AzimuthAngle:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\in [0, 360]` deg

Azimuth angle of the telescope, expressed in degrees. This angle, together with the tilt angle, characterises the orientation of the telescope pointing (i.e. telescope optical axis) w.r.t. the platform pointing. This parameter is only used if ``GroupID = Custom``.

The azimuth angle is the position angle of the rotation of the telescope around the positive :math:`z_{\rm PLM}` axis (see Figs. 4 and 5).

.. figure:: ../figures/config_tiltAzimuth.png
   :align: center
   :width: 300

   **Fig. 5**: Tilt and azimuth of camera.

**LightCollectingArea:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`> 0 \ \text{cm}^2`

Light-collecting area of one telescope.

**TransmissionEfficiency:**

The transmission efficiency of the optical system, considering the passband and the spectral energy distribution of the stars, given the ``Fluxm0`` parameter and the magnitudes in the star catalogue degrades linearly over the mission lifetime. The following two parameters are used to model the (linear) degradation in transmission efficiency over the mission lifetime:

  TransmissionEfficiency/**BOL:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\in [0, 1]`

  Tranmission efficiency of the optical system, considering the passband and spectral energy distribution of the stars, given the ``Fluxm0`` parameter and the magnitudes in the star catalogue, at the beginning of the mission (BOL).

  TransmissionEfficiency/**EOL:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\in [0, 1]`

  Tranmission efficiency of the optical system, considering the passband and spectral energy distribution of the stars, given the ``Fluxm0`` parameter and the magnitudes in the star catalogue, at the end of the mission (EOL).

**UseDrift:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` ``yes`` and ``no``

Indicates whether the thermo-elastic drift of the camera (w.r.t. the platform) should be taken into account. Similar to the ``UseJitter`` parameter for the platform jitter.

PlatoSim can also account for the thermo-elastic drift, of the camera (w.r.t. the platform). A time series of displacements, expressed in Euler angles (yaw, pitch, roll), either has to be provided as a drift file or will be generated based on the given drift parameters shown below.

The Euler angles (yaw, pitch, roll) are defined as the rotation angles around the :math:`Z_{\rm PLM}`, :math:`Y'_{\rm PLM}`, and :math:`Z_{\rm CAM} = Z_{\rm FP}` axes, such that the anges increase with a clockwise rotation when looking along the positive axes (see Fig. 6).

.. figure:: ../figures/config_cameraGroupRotation.png
   :align: center
   :width: 800

   **Fig. 6**: Reference transformation from the platform to the camera reference system.


The camera reference frame can be obtained from the payload module reference frame by first rotating the :math:`(X_{\rm PLM} \,,Y_{\rm PLM})` plane around the pointing axis :math:`Z_{\rm PLM}` over an angle :math:`\eta_{\rm CAM}` (left panel), then rotating the resulting :math:`Z'_{\rm PLM}` axis over a tilt angle :math:`\rho_{\rm CAM}` around the :math:`Y'_{\rm PLM}` axis (middle panel), and finally rotating over an angle :math:`(2π − \eta_{\rm CAM} = -\eta_{\rm CAM})` around the :math:`Z''_{\rm PLM}` (right panel).

**DriftSource:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` ``FromRedNoise`` and ``FromFile``

Indicates from where to read the drift:

* ``FromRedNoise``: the drift positions must be generated from the drift parameters
* ``FromFile``: the drift time series must be read from a drift file

**DriftYawRms:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\ge 0` arcsec

Standard deviation of the normal distribution (with zero mean) describing the yaw value from one drift position to the next one. This parameter is only used if ``DriftSource = FromRedNoise``.

**DriftPitchRms:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\ge 0` arcsec

Standard deviation of the normal distribution (with zero mean) describing the pitch value from one drift position to the next one. This parameter is only used if ``DriftSource = FromRedNoise``.

**DriftRollRms:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\ge 0` arcsec

Standard deviation of the normal distribution (with zero mean) describing the roll value from one drift position to the next one. This parameter is only used if ``DriftSource = FromRedNoise``.

**DriftTimeScale:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`> 0` s

Timescale of the drift (i.e. time between two subsequent drift positions). This parameter is only used if ``DriftSource = FromRedNoise``.

**DriftFileName:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` Path to _`Drift File`

If ``DriftSource = FromFile``, camera drift file must be provided in ascii format. This file should contain four columns, separated by a space, holding the following information:

* Time  [s]
* Yaw   [arcsec]
* Pitch [arcsec]
* Roll  [arcsec]

Nominal plate scale. This value affects the visible FOV of the CCD.

**FocalPlaneOrientation:**

The orientation of the focal plane can either be kept constant over the simulations or vary, according to the values in a file provided by the user. For an angle of :math:`0^{\circ}`, the :math:`Y_{\rm CCD}` axis of the CCD (with an orientation angle of :math:`0^{\circ}`) points towards the North. A positive angle corresponds to a counter-clockwise rotation. Have a look at Fig. 7 for more details.

.. figure:: ../figures/config_focalPlaneCoordinateSystem.png
   :align: center
   :width: 550

   **Fig. 7**: A schematic overview of the focal plane with 4 CCDs.

The optical axis :math:`Z_{\rm FP}` is the blue dot in the middle of the 4 CCDs and points in the positive direction towards the reader. The jitter roll axis :math:`Z_{\rm CAM}` is the purple dot, and also points in the positive direction towards the reader. The focal plane is rotated by the angle :math:`\gamma_{\rm FP}` w.r.t. to the North direction. The origin of the CCD in the focal plane is defined by its offset :math:`(\Delta X_{\rm CCD}, \Delta Y_{\rm CCD})` in mm from the centre of the focal plane. It is then rotated by the angle :math:`\gamma_{\rm CCD}` round its origin.
   	   
  FocalPlaneOrientation/**Source:** :guilabel:`Allowed values`  ``ConstantValue`` and ``FromFile``

**IncludeAberrationCorrection:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` ``yes`` and ``no``

Indicates whether or not to apply the aberration correction to all star positions in the star catalogue.

**AberrationCorrection:**

The calculation of the aberration correction is based on a elliptic earth orbit around the sun and does likewise take the `Lissajous orbit <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissajous_orbit>`_ of the satellite around L2 into account. We do calculate the kinematic aberration both in an absolute sense and differentially. The latter will be the observant for PLATO data products due to a absolute correction by the fine guidance sensor. The following parameters are only applicable if ``IncludeAberrationCorrection = yes``:

  AberrationCorrection/**Type:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` ``differential`` and ``absolute``

  Indicates whether to apply either differential or absolute aberration correction.

  AberrationCorrection/**OrbitFile:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` Path to _`Orbit File`

The field distortion is represented by Distortion model from `Wang et al. (2007) <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031320307003020>`_ with coefficients: :math:`(k_1, \, k_2, \, k_3, \, q_1, \, q_2, \, p_1, \, p_2)`. Note that the default distortion coefficients are only applicable for the Wang model of the N-CAMs used for when ``PSF/Model = AnalyticNonGaussian`` (see :ref:`PSF block <run_input_parameters_psf>`). 

  FieldDistortion/**Source:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` ``ConstantValue`` and  ``FromFile``

  Indicates that the field distortion is calculated from a ``ConstantValue`` (constant in time) or ``FromFile`` (time dependent). The latter needs to be a time series of the field distortion coefficients and their inverse in two files in ascii format.

  Inverse coefficients for the Wang model that converts the normalised distorted pixel coordinates (i.e. pixel coordinates divided by the focal length in pixels) to the (negative) distortion, expressed in normalised pixel coordinates. This entry is only applicable if ``FieldDistortion/Source = ConstantValue``.
  
  FieldDistortion/**CoefficientsFromFile:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` Path to _`Field Distortion` file

  If ``FieldDistortion/Source = FromFile``, a time series of the change in field distortion must be provided in a acsii file. This file should contain two columns, separated by a space, holding the following information:

  * Time [s]
  * Field distortion coefficients (all separated by spaces)

  FieldDistortion/**InverseCoefficientsFromFile:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` Path to Inverse Distortion File

  If ``FieldDistortion/Source = FromFile``, a time series of the change in field distortion must be provided in a acsii file. This file should contain two columns, separated by a space, holding the following information:

  * Time [s]

**IncludePointLikeGhosts:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` ``yes`` and ``no``

Indicates whether or not point-like ghosts must be included.

**IncludeExtendedGhosts:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` ``yes`` and ``no``

Indicates whether or not extended ghosts must be included.

.. figure:: ../figures/config_TOU.png
   :align: center
   :width: 550

   **Fig. 8**: A schematic overview the Telescope Optical Unit (TOU). Credit: ESA.

Note that the flux loss of the sources (due to reflection off the CCD surface) is included in the quantum efficiency.

  Ghosts/**PointLike:**

  A star at focal-plane coordinates :math:`(x, y)` will produce a point-like ghost at focal-plane coordinates :math:`(-x, -y)` (i.e. at the opposite side of the optical axis on another CCD), as long as it is within the distance cut-off from the optical axis. This point-like ghost is caused by reflections on the CCD surface and both window surfaces (see Fig. 8).
  
    Ghosts/PointLike/**FluxRatio:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`> [0, 1]`

    Irradiance ratio of the point-like ghost w.r.t. the source producing it, measured on-axis. The flux ratio off-axis decreases linearly from the optical axis to the distance cut-off (where it drops to zero), due to vignetting by the pupil around L3. This entry is only applicable if ``IncludePointLikeGhosts = yes``.

    Ghosts/PointLike/**DistanceCutOff:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`> 0` deg

    Distance from the optical axis beyond which sources no longer produce point-like ghosts. At this distance, the flux ratio has dropped to zero. This entry is only applicable if ``IncludePointLikeGhosts = yes``.

  Ghosts/**Extended:**

  A star at focal-plane coordinates :math:`(x, y)` will produce an extended ghost further away from the optical axis. This ghost image is caused by reflections on the CCD surface and the back surface of L6.
  
    Ghosts/Extended/**FluxRatio:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`> [0, 1]`

    Irradiance ratio of the extended ghost w.r.t. the source producing it. This entry is only applicable if ``IncludeExtendedGhosts = yes``.
    
    Ghosts/Extended/**RadiusCoefficients:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`> \{0, 0, 0\}`

    Coefficients of the 2nd order polynomial (in distance from the optical axis), describing the radius of the (circular) extended source. This entry is only applicable if ``IncludeExtendedGhosts = yes``.
    
    Ghosts/Extended/**DistanceRatio:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`> 0` deg

    A star at focal-plane coordinates :math:`(x, y)` will produce a ghost at focal-plane coordinates (``distanceRatio`` :math:`\cdot x`, ``distanceRatio`` :math:`\cdot y`). This entry is only applicable if ``IncludeExtendedGhosts = yes``.

* Operating temperature of the FEE [K]

**ReadoutNoise:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\ge 0 \ \text{e}^- \, \text{pixel}^{-1}` 

Mean readout noise of the FEE. This is the same for both ADCs.

**Gain:**

The actual gain for the FEE will be different for both ADCs. A reference value is given for ADC1 and ADC2, and the difference should not exceed the specified allowed difference.

The electronic offset or bias level is added to the digital signal in order to avoid negative readout values. The electronic offset can be measured in a prescan strip, which essentially consists of a few additional rows of the CCD. These rows only contain the electronic offset and the readout noise. This prescan strip consisting of ``NumPreScanRows`` rows will be stored in the output file. This is the same for both ADCs.

   Over-/undershoot is currently only availble for fast cameras (``GroupID = Fast``). 

**OverAndUnderShoot:**

Over-/undershoot has been noticed in F-FEE measurements. Looking at the content of a readout register at any given time, the charges in any pixels will affect the next pixels in the readout register, further away from the readout register, e.g. at a distance :math:`\Delta x`. For a difference in signal between two such pixels, :math:`\Delta S`, the induced over-/undershoot will be:

**Position:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` ``1``, ``2``, ``3``, ``4``, and ``Custom``

The CCD position can be used to select a specific predefined CCD or a custom one. The predefined CCD positions are shown in the Fig. 11 and 12.

   **Fig. 12**: Layout of the CCDs for the F-CAMs.

When you specify ``Position=Custom``, the origin offset ``OriginOffsetX`` and ``OriginOffsetY``, the orientation, number of rows, and columns, and the first exposed row of the CCD are read from the configuration parameters in the :ref:`CCD block <run_input_parameters_ccdpos>`. 

**OriginOffsetX:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\in \mathbb{R}` mm

Offset of the CCD origin from the centre of the optical plane (i.e. the intersection of the optical axis with the focal plane) in the y-direction. The origin of the CCD is defined as the point where the readout register is located. See Fig. 7 for more details (:math:`\Delta x_{\rm CCD}`). Parameter used if ``Position = Custom``.

**OriginOffsetY:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\in \mathbb{R}` mm

Offset of the CCD origin from the centre of the optical plane (i.e. the intersection of the optical axis with the focal plane) in the y-direction. The origin of the CCD is defined as the point where the readout register is located. See Fig. 7 for more details (:math:`\Delta y_{\rm CCD}`). Parameter used if ``Position = Custom``.


**Orientation:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\in [0, 360]` deg

Orientation angle of the CCD w.r.t. the orientation of the focal plane, measured counterclockwise and expressed in degrees. This rotation is performed around the offset origin of the CCD. See Fig. 7 for more details (:math:`\gamma_{\rm CCD}`). Parameter used if ``Position = Custom``

**NumColumns:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\ge 0` pixel

**FirstRowExposed:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\ge 0` pixel

Row index of the first row in the CCD that is illuminated (the row closest to the readout register is row 0). Parameter used if ``Position = Custom``.

**TimeShift:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\ge 0` s

Time shift between the readout of the CCDs [s]. Parameter used if ``Position = Custom``.

**PixelSize:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\ge 0` micron

Nominal pixel size.

**BFE:**

Brighter-Fatter Effect (BFE) modelled following the method proposed by `Guyonnet et al. 2015 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01577>`_.

  BFE/**CoefficientsFileName:** Path to _`BFE Coefficients` file

  Path to the HDF5 file comprising the coefficients ``a`` for the BFE.

**Gain:**

The actual gain for the CCD will be different for both detector halves. A reference value is given for both halves, and the difference should not exceed the specified allowed difference ``AllowedDifference`` given below.

  Gain/**RefValueLeft:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`> 0 \ \mu\text{V}/\text{e}^-`.

  Reference value of the gain of the left- and right-hand side of the CCD at its nominal operating temperature.

  Gain/**RefValueRight:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`> 0 \ \mu\text{V}/\text{e}^-`.

  Reference value of the gain of ACD2 of the FEE at its nominal operating temperature.

  Gain/**Stability:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\in \mathbb{R} \ \mu\text{V}/\text{e}^-/\text{K}`

  Change in gain (for both CCD halves) with temperature deviations from the nominal operating temperature.

  Gain/**AllowedDifference:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\in [0, 100] \ \mu\text{V}/\text{e}^-`.

  Percentage of the reference values for the gain of the left- and right-hand side of the CCD that indicates the maximum allowed difference between these gain values.

  Gain/**Nonlinearity:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\in \{\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R}\}`

  CCD gain non-linearity model coefficients of the polynomial:

  :math:`O = B + I + a0 + a_1 \cdot I + a_2 \cdot I^2`,

  with :math:`O` being the output signal [ADU], :math:`B` the bias level [ADU], and :math:`I` is the input signal [ADU].
  
**QuantumEfficiency:**

Quantum efficiency is the ratio of the number of collected electrons to the number of incident photons, considering the passband and the spectral energy distribution of the stars given the ``Fluxm0`` and the magnitude of the stars in the star catalogue.

  QuantumEfficiency/**MeanQuantumEfficiency:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\in [0, 1]`

  Mean throughput efficiency due to quantum efficiency (i.e. the mean over all pixels of one detector).

  QuantumEfficiency/**MeanAngleDependency:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\in [1, 2]`

  Reference angle for the throughput efficiency due to the quantum efficiency.

**FullWellSaturation:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`> 0 \ \text{e}^- \, \text{pixel}^{-1}` 
     
Full-well saturation limit of a single CCD pixel. If a pixels receives more electrons than its full-well saturation limit, the additional electrons flow evenly distributed in positive and negative charge-transfer direction, a phenomenon called *blooming*. The electrons reaching the edge of the CCD will not be detected.

**DigitalSaturation:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`> 0 \ \text{ADU} \ ,\text{pixel}^{-1}`

Digital saturation limit of the CCD to which pixel values are topped off. This value depends on the A/D convertor of the detector. For a 16-bit convertor, the digital saturation limit is :math:`655\,36` ADU. The gain of the front-end electronics and detector should be such that the full-well saturation results in values below the digital saturation limit.

**ReadoutNoise:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\ge 0 \ \text{e}^- \, \text{pixel}^{-1}`

Mean readout noise of the detector. Readout noise occurs due to the imperfect nature of the CCD amplifiers. When the electrons are transferred to the amplifier, the induced voltage is measured. However, this measurement is not perfect, but gives a value which is on average too high by an amount of the readout noise, with the square-root of the readout noise as standard deviation (we add the readout noise of the FEE and the CCD in quadrature).

**SerialTransferTime:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`> 0` ns

Time required to shift the content of the readout register over one pixel, towards the output node.  This is not only relevant for the image area but also for the serial prescan (i.e. bias register map) and the serial over-scan (which has not been implemented).

**ParallelTransferTime:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`> 0 \, \mu\text{s}`

Time required to shift the charges one row down (towards the readout register) in case the readout register will be read out by the FEE. The difference with ``ParallelTransferTimeFast`` is due to two delay parameters recommended by Teledyne e2v for clock settling. Settling times are to ensure one clock has reached its low level before another clock starts to rise. It ensures good charge transfer, as without it you could cause charge to be lost. This is particularly the case when dealing with the (parallel) transfer into the readout register, as the rise and fall times of the image clocks are a lot slower than those of the register clocks.

**ParallelTransferTimeFast:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\ge 0 \, \mu\text{s}`

Time required to shift the charges one row down (towards the readout register) in case the readout register will not be read out by the FEE. In that case clock settling is not needed, hence the difference with ``ParallelTransferTime``.

**ReadoutMode:**

This determines how the CCD is read out. The readout mode can either be Nominal or Partial. Nominal readout mode mode will read out all the 4510 rows starting at row 0 for normal cameras, and only 2255 rows starting at row 2255 for the fast cameras (the lower half of the CCD is shielded off). For the Partial readout mode, only certain rows are read out. These rows can be on the upper half of the CCD for the fast cameras and on the entire CCD for the normal cameras. 

  ReadoutMode/**ReadoutMode:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` ``Nominal`` and ``Partial``

  ReadoutMode/**Partial:**
  
  Configuration settings for when ``ReadoutMode = Partial``:

    ReadoutMode/Partial/**FirstRowReadout:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\ge 0` pixel

    First row that will be read out by the FEE.

    ReadoutMode/Partial/**NumRowsReadout:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\ge 0` pixel

    Numbers of rows that will be read out by the FEE.

**Flatfield:**

Local Pixel Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU), defined as the standard deviation in the signal level (:math:`S_i`), divided by the mean signal (:math:`\overline{S}`):

:math:`\text{PRNU} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (S_i - \overline{S})^2}}{\overline{S}}`

The flatfield is only applied if ``IncludeFlatfield = yes``.

  Flatfield/**Source:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` ``FromRedNoise`` and ``FromFile``

  Indicates whether the flatfield map is generated as random red noise (``FromRedNoise``) or read from a file (``FromFile``).

  Flatfield/FromFile/**FilePath:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` Path to _`PRNU File`

  HDF5 file holding a full-CCD PRNU map in the dataset ``/PRNU`` (number of rows :math:`\times` number of columns of the CCD). PlatoSim cuts out the part that corresponds to the subfield. This entry is only applicable if ``Flatfield/Source = FromFile``.

  Flatfield/FromRedNoise/**FlatfieldNoiseRMS:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\ge 0`

  RMS of the generated PRNU map. This entry is only applicable if ``Flatfield/Source = FromRedNoise``.

.. note::

   Before PlatoSim 3.8.0 this parameter was called ``CCD/FlatfieldNoiseRMS``. Use the :doc:`migration tool <install_migtool>` to update older configuration files.

**RelativeTransmissivity:**

On top of the (time-dependent) transmission efficiency, the overall relative transmissivity should be taken into account.  This decrease in efficiency with distance to the optical axis, comprises the following contributions:

* Natural vignetting (brightness attenuation towards the edges of the FOV, introduced by the view factor of the entrance pupil)
* Mechanical vignetting (due to the undersized mask at the entrance pupil), incl. total blockage of all incoming radiation beyond the edge of the FOV
* Glass absorption + anti-reflective coating

  RelativeTransmissivity/**Coefficients:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`> \{0, 0, 0\}`

  Coefficients :math:`k_1, \, k_2, \, k_3` for the polynomial that converts the distance from the optical axis, :math:`\theta` (expressed in degrees), to the variation in the overall relative transmissivity (expressed in percentage):

  :math:`P(\theta) = k_1 \cdot \theta^2 + k_2 \cdot \theta^4 + k_3 \cdot \theta^6`.

  RelativeTransmissivity/**RadiusFOV:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`> 0` deg

  Radius of the FOV. Beyond this radius all incoming flux (apart from the cosmic hits) is shielded off.

  RelativeTransmissivity/**ExpectedValue:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\in [0, 1]`

  Expected value of the throughput efficiency due to the overall relative transmissivity (i.e. the mean over all pixels of one detector, within the FOV).

**Polarization:**

Optical elements induce a preferred direction for the propagation of light. This effect is called polarisation.

  Polarization/**ExpectedValue:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\in [0, 1]`

  Expected value of the throughput efficiency due to polarisation (i.e. the mean over all pixels of one detector). Currently no information on the angle dependency of polarisation is available and hence this value will be used for the whole FOV, until further notice.

**Contamination:**

The contribution to contamination is two-fold:

* Particulate contamination is the unintended presence of particles on (optical) surfaces, which leads to straylight and influences the effciency
* Molecular contamination is caused chiefly by outgassing of materials in the first phase of the mission and affects all surfaces (the down side of L2 and the CCD will be affected the most).

  Contamination/**ParticulateContaminationEfficiency:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\in [0, 1]`

  Throughput efficiency due to particulate contamination.

  Contamination/**MolecularContaminationEfficiency:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\in [0, 1]`

  Throughput efficiency due to molecular contamination.

**BadPixelMap:**

Map of dead pixels. A pixel flagged as bad has its signal set to zero.

  BadPixelMap/**includeBadPixelMap:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` ``yes`` and ``no``

  Indicates whether or not to apply a bad pixel map.

  BadPixelMap/**badPixelParameter:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\in [0, 1]`

  Parameter that governs the distribution of bad pixels. For now this is the probability for a pixel to be bad, drawn from a Bernoulli distribution (see also ``RandomSeeds/BadPixelSeed``).

**DarkSignal:**

Dark signal is the relatively small electric current that is generated in the CCD when no outside radiation is entering the device.

  DarkSignal/**DarkCurrent:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`> 0 \ \text{e}^-`

  Dark current of detector. This is the nominal value of the dark signal.

  DarkSignal/**DSNU:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\in [0, 100] \%`

  Dark Signal Non-Uniformity (DSNU), expressed as a percentage of the dark current. This is the systematic (fixed-pattern) deviation of a pixel's dark current from its nominal value.

  DarkSignal/**Stability:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\ge 0 \ \text{K}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-1}`

  Temperature stability of the dark current.

**CTI:**

Because of detector defects, electrons can get trapped in the readout process. The trapped charge ends up getting dissociated from its original pixel and eventually gets released into another pixel. The result is that the original image gets smeared out in the direction away from the readout amplifier (visible in the appearance of *charge trails*). This is known as Charge-Transfer Inefficiency (CTI).

The charge trails impact photometry, noise, and astrometry of sources. CTI removes flux from the central pixel and thus degrades the expected S/N for an observation. CTI trails bias measurements of source along the trail direction, which can severely impact high-precision astrometry.
  
  CTI/**Model:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` ``Simple``, ``Short2013``, ``Short2013FromFile``

  PlatoSim offers two implementation of the CTI:

  * The simple implementation (``Simple``) assumes that for each row transfer (in the direction of the readout register) a fraction of the charge is not transferred to the next row, but stays behind. It will be released by later row transfers.
  * A more sophisticated implementation (``Short2013``) is based on the paper by `Short et al. (2013) <http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/430/4/3078.full.pdf>`_, in which only parallel readout is taken into account.

*Subfield*
..........

The **SubField** block of the configuration file contains all the information about the subfield of the CCD that is modelled by the simulation. The structure of this block is the following:

.. code-block::

   SubField:

     ZeroPointRow:                    0               
     ZeroPointColumn:                 0

     NumSmearingOverscanRows:         30              
     SubPixels:                       8               

Figure 11 shows a schematic representation of the subfield and the parameters required to define it. The CCD focal plane array shows also the metallic shields of the F-CAM (purple colored areas).

   :width: 900

   **Fig. 11**: Left: CCD focal plane with location subfield. Right: Simulated CCD subfield.

**ZeroPointRow:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`> 0` pixel

Row of the origin of the subfield in the detector.

**ZeroPointColumn:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`> 0` pixel

Column of the origin of the subfield in the detector.

**NumColumns:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\ge 6` pixel

Number of columns in the subfield.

**NumColumns:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\ge 6` pixel

Number of rows in the subfield.

**NumBiasPrescanRows:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\ge 0` pixel

Number of rows in the prescan strip (see Fig. 11). There are two such strips, on either side of the detector image (serial prescan and overscan), and they contain the electronic offset and readout noise of the adjacent detector half.

This parameter is configurable (and not fixed to the number of rows in the detector or the subfield), because we want: 1) to avoid the bias maps to take up too much space in the output file, and 2) be able to do accurate bias correction for the photometric reduction (thus want to avoid small noisy bias maps).

**NumBiasPrescanColumns:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\ge 0` pixel

Number of columns in the prescan strip (see Fig. 11). There are two such strips, on either side of the detector image (serial prescan and overscan), and they contain the electronic offset and readout noise of the adjacent detector half.

**NumSmearingOverscanRows:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\ge 0` pixel

Number of rows in the parallel overscan strip (see Fig. 11). This strip is located at the top of the sub-field that is modelled in detail and contains the star smearing due to the absence of a shutter. The flux in this strip is also affected by the electronic offset, readout noise, and shot noise. Not included are the PRNU, cosmic hits, and charge-transfer inefficiency (CTI).

**SubPixels:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`\in [1, 128]` subpixel

Number of subpixels squared. If you want a pixel of :math:`16 \times 16 = 256` subpixels, you should set this value to 16 subpixels. By default this parameter is only 8 subpixels to keep the computational resources low.

*Photometry*
............

The **Photometry** block of the configuration file contains all information to run photometry. The structure of this block is the following:

.. code-block::

   Photometry:

     IncludePhotometry:               no
     ContaminationRadius:             4
     MaskUpdateInterval:              14.0
     TargetFileName:                  inputfiles/photometry.txt

PlatoSim utilises the *optimal aperture photometry* algortihm from `Marchiori et al. (2019) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00892>`_. This method is optimised to lower the photometric noise relevant for planet transit searches. This algorithm allows to update the aperture mask with a user defined interval. Fig. 12 shows an example of an extracted light curve for a :math:`V=11` star using a mask-update of 14 days (enhanced by the 1 hour running median filter shown in green).

.. figure:: ../figures/photometry.png
   :align: center
   :width: 600

   **Fig. 12**: Optimal aperture photometry with mask-updates every 14 days.

**IncludePhotometry:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` ``yes`` and ``no``

Indicates whether or not photometry should be run.

**ContaminationRadius:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`> 0` pixel

Radius around a target within which sources are considered contaminants when calculating the photometry for that target.

**MaskUpdateInterval:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`> 0` days

Update interval to update the photometry mask.

**TargetFileName:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` Path to _`Photometry List` file

Path of the file comprising the list of targets identifiers (as listed in the star catalogue in a single column). The path to the photometry list can be an absolute path or relative to the :ref:`project location <run_input_parameters_general>`.

.. _run_input_parameters_seed:

*Random seeds*
.................

The **RandomSeeds** block of the configuration file contains all the seeds for random-number generation in the simulator. The structure of this block is the following:

.. code-block::

   RandomSeeds:

     ReadOutNoiseSeed:            1424949740
     PhotonNoiseSeed:             1433320336
     JitterSeed:                  1433320381
     FlatFieldSeed:               1425284070
     DriftSeed:                   1433429158
     CosmicSeed:                  1494750830
     DarkSignalSeed:              1468838669
     BadPixelSeed:                1443910483

Below each random seed can be set to a value of ``-1``, which imply that the computer time at the start of the simulation will be used. That way, the fast-forward of the random generator when using Slurm is no longer needed (which is better for performance reasons). Note that the actual value that is used, will be written to the output HDF5 file.
     
**ReadOutNoiseSeed:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`> 0 \, \text{and} \, -1`

Seed for the random-number generator used for the readout noise.

**PhotonNoiseSeed:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`> 0 \, \text{and} \, -1`

Seed for the random-number generator used for the photon noise.

**JitterSeed:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`> 0 \, \text{and} \, -1`

Seed for the random-number generator used for the jitter.

**FlatFieldSeed:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`> 0 \, \text{and} \, -1`

Seed for the random-number generator used for the flatfield.

**DriftSeed:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`> 0 \, \text{and} \, -1`

Seed for the random number generator used for the drift.

**CosmicSeed:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`> 0 \, \text{and} \, -1`

Seed for the random-number generators for the cosmics.

**DarkSignalSeed:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`> 0 \, \text{and} \, -1`

Seed for the random-number generators for the dark signal.

**BadPixelSeed:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` :math:`> 0 \, \text{and} \, -1`

Seed for the random-number generator for the bad pixel map.

.. warning::

   To avoid jumps in the power spectrum when using auto-generated red noise **jitter** and/or **drift** models, it is advised to take special care in setting the random seeds. Another options is to generate these red noise time series for the whole simulation beforehand, write these values to a file, and reading in that file when simulating the different chunks.

*Control HDF5 content*
......................

The **ControlHDF5Content** block of the configuration file controls which data is written to the HDF5 output file (see :doc:`Output files <run_output>`). The structure of this block is the following:

.. code-block::

   ControlHDF5Content:

     GroupByExposure:                 yes
     WritePixelMaps:                  yes
     WriteBiasMaps:                   yes

     WriteCosmics:                    yes
     WriteBadPixelMap:                yes

**GroupByExposure:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` ``yes`` and ``no``

This entry controls the exact output structure of the groups ``StarPositions``, ``PointLikeGhostPositions``, and ``ExtendedGhostPositions``:

* If ``yes``: all information is saved in folders **per exposure**
* if ``no`` : all information is saved **per star ID**.

For long baseline simulations (more than :math:`100\,000` exposures), we recommend to use the latter option since this can significantly lower the computational resources (time and memory). The cosmic rays are not affected by this setting (see :doc:`Output files <run_output>`).

**WritePixelMaps:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` ``yes`` and ``no``

Indicates whether or not the pixel maps must be stored in the output file.

**WriteBiasMaps:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` ``yes`` and ``no``

Indicates whether or not the bias register maps must be stored in the output file.

**WriteSmearingMaps:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` ``yes`` and ``no``

Indicates whether or not the smearing maps must be stored in the output file.

**WriteFlatfieldMap:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` ``yes`` and ``no``

Indicates whether or not the flatfield maps must be stored in the output file.

**WriteThroughputMaps:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` ``yes`` and ``no``

Indicates whether or not the throughput maps must be stored in the output file.

**WriteTransmissionEfficiency:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` ``yes`` and ``no``

Indicates whether the Transmission Efficiency should be stored in the output file.

**WriteCTI:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` ``yes`` and ``no``

Indicates whether the CTI maps should be stored in the output file. This is the trap density maps at BOL and EOL for each species.

**WriteSubPixelImages:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` ``yes`` and ``no``

Indicates whether or not the sub-pixel maps must be stored in the output file. Only do this for a small number of exposures, as this takes up a lot of space.

**WriteHighResolutionPSF:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` ``yes`` and ``no``

Indicates whether or not a high resolution image of the PSF should be stored in the output file. This feature does not work for Analytic Gaussian PSF.

**WriteDiffusedPSF:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` ``yes`` and ``no``

Indicates whether or not a high resolution image of the PSF with diffusion applied to it should be stored in the output file. This features only works for the mapped PSF and takes a long time to compute.

**WriteACS:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` ``yes`` and ``no``

**WriteStarCatalog:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` ``yes`` and ``no``

Indicates whether or not the starcatalog should be stored in the output file.

**WriteStarPositions:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` ``yes`` and ``no``

**WriteGhostPositions:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` ``yes`` and ``no``

Indicates whether or not the ghost positions should be stored in pixel and focal plane coordinates in the output file. This scales with the number of exposures and the number of stars in the sub-field.

**WriteCosmics:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` ``yes`` and ``no``

Indicates whether or not the columns, rows and flux of the cosmics should be stored in the output file. This scales with the number of exposures.

**WriteBadPixelMap:** :guilabel:`Allowed values` ``yes`` and ``no``

Indicates whether or not the bad pixel map (binary values) should be stored in the output file. Only applicable if ``CCD/BadPixelMap/includeBadPixelMap = yes``.
