Welcome to PlatoSim's documentation!
====================================

The PLATO Simulator (PlatoSim) is an end-to-end software tool, designed to perform realistic simulations of the
expected observations of the PLATO mission. Our simulator simulates time series of CCD images by including models of
the stellar field, the spacecraft systematics, the jitter movements of the spacecraft, the camera optics, the CCD and
its electronics, and all important natural sources of noise.

PlatoSim is a highly versatile tool ideal to model the complex interplay of various noise sources needed for the
performance assessment and design study of any space-based mission. PlatoSim is widely used by the PLATO Mission
Consortium (PMC) to also conduct scientific studies related to the core and complementary program of the mission. Being
an indispensable tool in the preparation of the PLATO mission, we hope that you find PlatoSim a useful tool in your
research. Please consult:

- All information needed to install and update PlatoSim is described in the sections: :doc:`Installation
  <install_overview>` and :doc:`Running PlatoSim <run_overview>`. Please, follow these instructions carefully before
  running PlatoSim. 
- The PlatoSim software package includes a Python interface (with a suite of tools) which we
  explain in our `Python tutorials <https://github.com/IvS-KULeuven/PlatoSim3/tree/develop/docs/tutorials>`_. We highly
  recommend to use this interface to avoid sudden software errors when updating your code (since our Python interface
  is kept backward compatible with previous software versions). 
- Particularly relevant for simulating multi-camera imagette time series or light curves, the PlatoSim toolkit called 
  :doc:`PLATOnium <platonium_overview>` may be of interest. 
- In case of questions or problems, see our :doc:`Troubleshooting <basic_troubleshooting>` section. 
- For more information about the building blocks of PlatoSim, consult the :doc:`Architecture <basic_architecture>` 
  section and the :doc:`PlatoSim3 paper <basic_acknowledgements>`.
