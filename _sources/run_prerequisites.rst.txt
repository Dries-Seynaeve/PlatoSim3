*Export environment variables*
------------------------------

To avoid having to hardcode any paths in configuration files, tutorials, etc., you must export three environment variables:

* ``PLATO_PROJECT_HOME``: refer to the directory in which PlatoSim3 was installed. The Python interface looks for the ``platosim`` executable in its ``build/`` (source installation) or ``bin/`` (Conda installation) sub-directory.
* ``PLATO_WORKDIR``: refer to your working directory were you should store your own configuration files and save your simulations (preferably not within the PlatoSim installation directory).
* ``PYTHONPATH``: refer to the directory in which our Python scripts can be found.

Before exporting any environment variables, first make sure to activate your Python environment (your Conda environment, or ``source .venv/bin/activate`` for a source installation with uv). If you have installed PlatoSim as a :doc:`user (via Conda) <install_conda>`, the home location of the PlatoSim project needs to be exported as:

.. code-block:: shell

   export PLATO_PROJECT_HOME=$CONDA_PREFIX

On the other hand, if you installed PlatoSim as a :doc:`developer (from Source) <install_source>`, this environment variable needs to be exported as:
   
.. code-block:: shell

   export PLATO_PROJECT_HOME=<full/path/to/PlatoSim3>

Next, choose a PlatoSim working directory and export the two following environment variables (which are independent on if you are a user or a developer):
   
.. code-block:: shell
		
   export PLATO_WORKDIR=<full/path/to/working/directory>
   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$PLATO_PROJECT_HOME/python
   
Lastly, check that the exported paths are set to the proper locations with:

.. code-block:: shell

   echo $PLATO_PROJECT_HOME
   echo $PLATO_WORKDIR
   echo $PYTHONPATH
 
We recommend that you place these three environment variables in a ``.bash_profile`` script that can be read by your system at all times.

.. note::

   You should now be able to run PlatoSim from the command line:

   .. code-block:: shell

      platosim -version

   and from a Python shell:

   .. code-block:: python

      import platosim

.. _run_prerequisites_storage:
   
*File storage*
--------------

To avoid problems when updating the PlatoSim software, it is best to store your own input and output files in a designated working directory. We recommend to use the path environment ``PLATO_WORKDIR`` as described above.

For all users that want to run PlatoSim from the terminal, we recommend that you copy the ``inputfile.yaml`` file (located within the directory ``$PLATO_PROJECT_HOME/inputfiles``) and modify the copy rather than the original file. Note that you can always download the ``inputfile.yaml`` directly from GitHub (from the branch matching your installation).

.. warning::

   **For users:** when you install a new version of PlatoSim in an existing Conda environment, all changes will be overwritten, and any files you may have added will be removed from the installation directory. Hence, better store your files outside of the installation directory.

   **For developers:** having downloaded the source code, should only make changes or add/remove files from the ``PlatoSim3/inputfiles`` directory (or any other directory) if a pull request is the end goal.
