Migration tool
==============

When new versions of PlatoSim are released, there might be some changes in the configuration or input files. New
parameters might have been added, or parameters or groups might have been restructured (e.g. ``CCD/FlatfieldNoiseRMS``
became ``CCD/Flatfield/FromRedNoise/FlatfieldNoiseRMS``). While using PlatoSim's Python interface such changes are
completely transparent if you simply use the default ``inputfile.yaml`` file and simply modify this through your
simulation object in your Python scripts.

If you run PlatoSim from the command line and have already existing YAML configuration files, PlatoSim will stop with a
configuration error in the log file. In the PlatoSim distribution we provide a helper tool to migrate your YAML
inputfiles to the new format: `migtool.py
<https://github.com/IvS-KULeuven/PlatoSim3/blob/develop/python/platosim/scripts/migtool.py>`_ in the
``python/platosim/scripts`` folder of the PlatoSim installation. This tool will compare your (old) YAML input file with
the default YAML input file that is on your local system, i.e. ``$PLATO_PROJECT_HOME/inputfiles/inputfile.yaml``. The
command can be used as follows:

.. code-block:: shell

   python $PLATO_PROJECT_HOME/python/platosim/scripts/migtool.py [-h] [-v] [-o outputFilename] inputFilename

If you ran the PLATOnium ``setup.sh`` script, the tool is also available as the command ``migtool``.

The ``-h`` option prints an instructive help message. The ``inputFilename`` is your (old) YAML inputfile. The ``-o``
option lets you specify the name of the output file in which the migrated configuration will be saved. When no output
file is given, the result will be printed on the screen (stdout). The ``-v`` option prints the changes that will be
applied on the screen. That might be useful, because it will signal changes in parameter values. An example is shown
below.

``CHECK`` means you will have to check manually. The value in your input file was 0.016 and the value in the new input
file is 0.01. Your value will be retained after the migration. The reason is that you probably have good reasons to
have this value different from the default value, and you don't want to lose that during the migration.

.. code-block:: shell

   CHECK - Value changed for CCD.FlatfieldPtPNoise from 0.016 to 0.01

Other possible output when using the ``-v`` option is signaled with ``DONE``, i.e. when a new key or sub-key has been
added or when an obsolete key has been removed. Note that a renamed or moved parameter is treated as an obsolete key
plus a new key, so its value is reset to the new default. Unfortunately, the Python module that we use to parse the
YAML files does not retain the comments that are in the files. Those comments will be lost after migration.
